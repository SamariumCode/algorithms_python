def move_zeros(sequence):
    """
    Moves all the zeros in the given list to the end, while maintaining the order of the other elements. 
    This function treats `False` as a non-zero value and keeps it in its original position, while only 
    moving actual `0` values to the end.

    The function counts the zeros (excluding `False`), appends all other non-zero elements to the result 
    list, and finally appends the appropriate number of zeros to the end.

    Parameters:
    sequence (list): A list that may contain integers, booleans, strings, or other types. The function 
                     will move all `0` values to the end but will leave `False` values in their original 
                     positions.

    Returns:
    list: A list where all `0` values have been moved to the end while maintaining the order of the other elements.

    Example:
    >>> move_zeros([False, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3, 'a'])
    [False, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 'a', 0, 0]

    Note:
    This function does not modify the original list, instead, it returns a new list.
